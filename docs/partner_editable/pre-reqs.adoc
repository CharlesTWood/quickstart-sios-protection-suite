==== Prepare your AWS account

1. If you don’t already have an AWS account, create one at https://aws.amazon.com by
following the on-screen instructions.
2. Use the region selector in the navigation bar to choose the AWS Region where you want
to deploy SIOS Protection Suite for Linux on AWS.
3. Create a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[key pair] in your preferred region.
4. If necessary, https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-[request a service limit increase] for the Amazon EC2 instance type desired. You might need to do this if you already have an existing deployment that uses this
instance type, and you think you might exceed the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html[default limit] with this reference deployment.
