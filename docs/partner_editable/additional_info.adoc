== Test the deployment

The easiest way to determine whether SIOS Protection Suite for Linux has been correctly
deployed and configured is to verify that the full stack has been created successfully, and
that the lcdstatus command reports that failover is allowed for all resources.

From the AWS Console navigate to the CloudFormation service page. Ensure you have the
proper region selected. If any stacks report CREATE_FAILED, remedy any errors reported
in the Events tab at the bottom of the webpage. Invalid parameter input is the most likely
cause for deployment failures. See the Troubleshooting section of this guide for more
details. When all stacks display CREATE_SUCCESS, go back to the EC2 service page, and
log in to either the bastion host or the optional Windows jump server. Follow the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html#ec2-connect-to-instance-linux[AWS guidelines] for connecting to your instances.

1. From the jump server node, use SSH to connect to the instance in the first Availability Zone.
2. Run **sudo /opt/LifeKeeper/bin/lcdstatus**
3. The output should contain two resources (/opt/sample_mirror, and datarep-sample), and both resources should report FAILOVER ALLOWED. Also, two known machines should be listed and reported as ALIVE.

== Best Practices

=== AWS services
SIOS recommends following AWS best practices for creating and using IAM roles and
policies, IAM user credentials and roles, and access key rotation.
* IAM roles: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_forservice.html
* IAM policies: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html
* IAM users: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_sign-in.html
* Access keys: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-rotate-access-keys-for-iam-users/

=== SIOS Protection Suite for Linux

SIOS also has some recommendations for customers seeking optimal performance. These
recommendations include considerations specific to both the Linux operating system and
the AWS Cloud configurations.

* Instance size - Performance relies on several factors. While CPU usage is minimal, RAM
utilization depends on application performance during peak active workload. The
recommended instance size for use with SIOS Protection suite for Linux is t2.medium,
but larger instances should be considered based on application workload.
* Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) - SIOS Protection
Suite does not add significantly to a typical cluster single-server outage failover RTO.
Assuming appropriate instance sizes are utilized, resource contention is not an issue,
SIOS Protection Suite for Linux is properly configured and all resources are in the
Online state, and assuming trivial application recovery time, an RTO of <1 minute is
possible. Realistically, an RTO of 2–5 minutes should be expected unless the application
being protected (MaxDB, SAP, etc.) has an unusually large recovery time.

Assuming the same conditions, RPO should be only a few milliseconds larger than the
current network write latency between the active and backup nodes. RPO is dependent
on replication software in use. In many cases, the RPO will be measured in milliseconds,
but factors like network congestion, abnormally high disk write activity, or slow write
performance can impact RPO greatly.
